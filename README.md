# eFuse Module TPS16413
User-friendly, breadboard-compatible circuit protection

Electronic Fuses (eFuses) are the future of circuit protection. They are faster, more accurate, and feature lower series resistance than conventional and PPTC fuses. Like PPTC fuses, eFuses are reusable. Unlike PPTC fuses, eFuses do not deteriorate over time. Some eFuses have additional features, such as power-on slew rate control to smooth out power-on current and voltage spikes. The eFuse Module TPS16413 also features a high-efficiency on-board LED to visually inform you of a fault condition much sooner than you can check voltages with a multimeter or feel an overheated PPTC fuse with your fingertips.

Unfortunately, eFuse chips are available only in surface-mount packages. This makes every eFuse chip on the market incompatible with your solderless prototyping breadboard. Besides that, the requirement for carefully selected external components makes the application of an eFuse chip a project in and of itself. This is why the eFuse Module TPS16413 exists: it is the hobbyist's entry point to experimentation with eFuses, and your chance to get a head start with this technology.

Designed with hobbyists in mind and featuring a through-hole footprint for a breadboard-friendly 2.54mm-pitch three-pin header, this module takes care of peripheral component selection and surface-mount assembly for you, giving you the versatility of eFuses while freeing up your time and attention to focus on the project you care about. All you have to do is select and solder a resistor to set the current limit, an optional timing capacitor, and a three-pin 0.1" header and your eFuse Module is ready to carry out its role in your breadboarded project. If the eFuse Module performs to your satisfaction in the solderless prototype, then you have a proven reference design that you can re-use as you move on to soldered and surface-mount prototypes.

This module is packaged in non-retail packaging; specifically, in the resealable ESD protection bag in which it arrived from the manufacturer. The ESD-safe bag may differ from the photograph and may bear one or more stickers. Three-pin header, current-selection resistors, and timing capacitors are **not included**. Through-hole soldering required.
